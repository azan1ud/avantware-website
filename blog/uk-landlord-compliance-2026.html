        <h1>MTD, EPC C, and the Renters' Rights Act: What UK Landlords Need to Know in 2026</h1>
        <p class="lead">Three major regulatory changes are converging on UK landlords — and two of them kick in within weeks. MTD starts 6 April 2026, Section 21 is abolished 1 May 2026, and the EPC Band C deadline is locked in for October 2030. Here's exactly what you need to do.</p>
      </header>

      <div class="blog-post-body">
        <h2>The compliance landscape is shifting fast</h2>
        <p>If you're a UK landlord, you're facing a regulatory environment that's changing more in the next few years than it has in the past decade. Three separate reforms are rolling out on overlapping timelines, each with its own requirements, penalties, and deadlines:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Making Tax Digital (MTD) for Income Tax</strong></li>
          <li><strong>EPC Band C minimum requirements</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The Renters' Rights Act</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Individually, each one requires planning. Together, they represent a fundamental shift in how rental properties are managed in the UK. Here's what you need to know.</p>

        <h2>1. Making Tax Digital for Income Tax</h2>
        <p>MTD for Income Tax Self Assessment (ITSA) is HMRC's push to digitise tax reporting for landlords and sole traders. The rollout is phased by income:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>6 April 2026:</strong> Mandatory for landlords and sole traders with gross income over <strong>&pound;50,000</strong> (based on 2024–25 tax year).</li>
          <li><strong>April 2027:</strong> Extends to those earning over <strong>&pound;30,000</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>April 2028:</strong> Extends to those earning over <strong>&pound;20,000</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you're in the first group, <strong>the deadline is five weeks away</strong>.</p>

        <h3>What changes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Quarterly digital updates:</strong> Instead of one annual Self Assessment, you'll submit income and expense summaries to HMRC every quarter through MTD-compatible software.</li>
          <li><strong>Digital record keeping:</strong> Paper records and spreadsheets no longer count. All records must be kept in HMRC-recognised digital software.</li>
          <li><strong>End-of-period statement:</strong> After your fourth quarterly update, you submit a finalisation statement — essentially replacing your Self Assessment return for property income.</li>
          <li><strong>New penalty regime:</strong> HMRC is introducing a points-based system for late submissions. However, <strong>penalty points won't be issued for late quarterly updates during your first year</strong> (2026/27 for April 2026 joiners) — giving you a limited grace period. Financial penalties for late Final Declarations and inaccuracies still apply from day one.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What landlords need to do</h3>
        <p>If you're above the &pound;50,000 threshold, you should already have MTD-compatible software set up and linked to HMRC. If you haven't started yet, do it now — your first quarterly reporting period begins on 6 April. Waiting means scrambling to backfill records and risking errors on your first submission.</p>

        <h2>2. EPC Band C minimum</h2>
        <p>The government's January 2026 Warm Homes Plan confirmed the EPC requirements for rental properties. All private rented properties must reach a minimum Energy Performance Certificate rating of <strong>Band C by 1 October 2030</strong>. The current minimum is Band E, and many rental properties still sit at D or below.</p>

        <h3>What this means</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>One single deadline:</strong> The government scrapped the previously proposed staggered approach (new tenancies first, existing later). Instead, <strong>all tenancies — new and existing — must meet Band C by 1 October 2030</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Fabric-first approach:</strong> The requirements focus on insulation, glazing, and window upgrades rather than more disruptive or expensive measures like heat pumps.</li>
          <li><strong>Upgrade costs:</strong> Reaching Band C from D or E typically requires improvements like loft insulation, double glazing, or a new boiler. Costs range from a few thousand to &pound;10,000+ depending on the property.</li>
          <li><strong>Spending cap:</strong> The cap is confirmed at <strong>&pound;10,000 per property</strong> (with lower caps for homes valued under &pound;100,000). If you spend up to the cap and still can't reach Band C, you can register an exemption — but you'll need documentation proving the spend.</li>
          <li><strong>Fines:</strong> Non-compliance carries penalties of <strong>up to &pound;30,000 per property</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>New EPC system coming</h3>
        <p>A new <strong>Home Energy Model (HEM)</strong> is replacing the current EPC methodology from 2026, measuring how well properties retain heat rather than how much energy they use. The new system becomes compulsory for EPCs on 1 October 2029 — meaning your property's rating could change under the new model even without physical changes.</p>

        <h3>What landlords need to do</h3>
        <p>Check the current EPC rating of every property in your portfolio. If any are below Band C, start getting quotes for fabric-first upgrades now. 2030 sounds far away, but energy improvement work takes time to schedule, contractors get booked up fast as deadlines approach, and the new HEM scoring system may shift your ratings. Start planning now while you still have time to phase the work across your portfolio.</p>

        <h2>3. The Renters' Rights Act</h2>
        <p>The Renters' Rights Act received Royal Assent on 27 October 2025 and is the biggest shake-up to private renting in England in a generation. The first phase comes into force on <strong>1 May 2026</strong> — two months from now.</p>

        <h3>Abolition of Section 21 ("no-fault") evictions — 1 May 2026</h3>
        <p>This is the headline change. From 1 May 2026, landlords <strong>can no longer serve Section 21 notices</strong>. Any Section 21 notice served on or after that date is invalid, and the local authority can impose a civil penalty of <strong>up to &pound;7,000</strong> for attempting it.</p>
        <p>Landlords can still serve Section 21 notices up to 30 April 2026, and can begin court proceedings using those notices until 31 July 2026. After that, no new possession claims under Section 21 can be made — ever.</p>
        <p>All evictions will require a <strong>Section 8 notice</strong> with a valid ground. The reformed mandatory grounds (1 and 1A) require <strong>four months' notice</strong> and cannot be used within the <strong>first 12 months</strong> of a new tenancy. This means you'll need thorough documentation of grounds like rent arrears, antisocial behaviour, or wanting to sell the property.</p>

        <h3>Periodic tenancies by default</h3>
        <p>Fixed-term tenancies are being replaced with rolling periodic tenancies. Tenants can leave with <strong>two months' notice</strong> at any point. Landlords can only end tenancies using the specified Section 8 grounds.</p>

        <h3>Landlord registration and the Ombudsman</h3>
        <p>All private landlords will need to register with a new <strong>Private Rented Sector Database</strong>. There will also be a new <strong>Ombudsman</strong> that tenants can use to resolve disputes, which landlords will be required to join. Non-registration will carry penalties.</p>

        <h3>Rent increase rules</h3>
        <p>Rent increases will be limited to <strong>once per year</strong> and must follow the Section 13 process. Tenants can challenge increases they consider above market rate at a tribunal.</p>

        <h3>What landlords need to do</h3>
        <p>The clock is ticking. Review your tenancy agreements and eviction procedures now — <strong>Section 21 is gone in two months</strong>. Make sure your documentation is thorough enough to rely on Section 8 grounds. Budget for registration fees and familiarise yourself with the Ombudsman process. If you're considering selling a property, the window before the 12-month restriction on mandatory grounds may influence your timing.</p>

        <h2>Why tracking all three matters</h2>
        <p>Look at the timeline: MTD starts <strong>6 April</strong>. Section 21 ends <strong>1 May</strong>. EPC upgrades need to be planned years in advance. For landlords with multiple properties, keeping track of which properties need EPC upgrades, which quarter's MTD submission is due, and whether your tenancy documents are compliant is a genuine administrative burden — and the penalty for getting it wrong is steep.</p>
        <p>Missing a quarterly MTD deadline triggers penalty points (and eventually fines). Letting a property below the EPC minimum brings fines of <strong>up to &pound;30,000 per property</strong>. Serving an invalid Section 21 notice carries a <strong>&pound;7,000 penalty</strong>. These aren't theoretical risks — they're specific dates with specific consequences.</p>

        <blockquote><p>The landlords who come through this transition smoothly won't be the ones who know every detail of every regulation. They'll be the ones who have a system that tracks it all for them.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>How LandlordShield helps</h2>
        <p>LandlordShield is a compliance dashboard built specifically for UK landlords navigating these changes. It tracks all three regulatory areas across your entire portfolio in one place:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>MTD timeline tracking:</strong> See your quarterly submission deadlines, track income and expenses per property, and get reminders before each filing window.</li>
          <li><strong>EPC monitoring:</strong> Log the current EPC rating for each property, track upgrade progress, and see which properties need attention before the deadline.</li>
          <li><strong>Renters' Rights readiness:</strong> Check your compliance status for registration, tenancy document requirements, and the new eviction ground procedures.</li>
          <li><strong>Portfolio-wide overview:</strong> A single dashboard that shows your compliance status across all properties and all three regulatory areas, with clear flags for anything that needs action.</li>
        </ul>
